**Project Title**: Java number guessing game

**Project Description**: a number guessing game where you choose the number to guess out of.

**Project Goals**: build a number guessing game for fun

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Make a user input for the user guesses
2. If statements to check if the number is below or above the correct guess
3. make a list of all the guess to be able to print how many times they guessed at the end.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Open up the link to the replit I created.
2. hit the run button
3. enter in a number when prompted for one.
4. enter numbers inbetween 1 and the given input until you guess the right one

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* I used replit.com with built in Java language programming

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] Add a function to check if the number exceeds or lower than the number input
* [ ] Put it up on a website and have the number guessing game more accessiable.
